        <h2>Communities of Reddit</h2>
        <h4>What is it?</h4>
        <p>
            I gathered data for over 110,000 subreddits. Then looked at the description for each one 
            to see if it linked to any other subreddits. Links generally indicate a connection between 
            the two subreddits. By doing this, I identified clusters of subreddits that form communities.
        </p>
        <p>
            Each node(dot) on the graph you are about to see represents a subreddit. Each edge(line) represents 
            a connection between two subreddits. The blobs of color represent closely connected subreddits, these 
            are communities.
        </p>
        <h4>Why?</h4>
        <p>
            I was inspired by a <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/1e596w/a_graph_of_reddit_linking_subs_based_on_internal/">
            a post on reddit</a> by <a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/sharkbait784">u/sharkbait784</a>. His graph were based on cross posts 
            between subreddits. I thought it would be interesting to see how subreddits are related based on links to other subreddits in the 
            descriptions of them.
